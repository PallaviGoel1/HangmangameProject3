# HANGMAN GAME
Hangman is a popular word puzzle game among kids. In this game, the player needs to guess the correct 
word based on the number of letters. At the start of the game, the player gets information as to the 
number of letters there are in the word and the hangman picture starts to draw on each incorrect guess.
And after certain incorrect guesses, a so-called man is hanged in the picture and the game ends with a loss.
If a player manages to guess the word correctly, it's a win.

# Future Roadmap
Though the app is complete and functioning smoothly, there are still few improvement/enhancements can be added later. Few of them are:

1-      More precise definition of different levels can be added

2-      Words list can be linked to a dictionary so that wider range of words could be available for user to guess from

3-      Number of wins and looses can be counted and added to screen every time game ends

4-      Historical records can be displayed

5-      User registration process can be included

# Quality Checks
I tried to perform thorough testing on this from various perspectives to ensure that final product would be a quality app. Some highlights from testing are:

## Validator Tests
All the code parts have been tested through in-built validator in IDE (codeanywhere) and passed the test after few fixes. Files with major code are:

1  Run.py

2  Word_1.py

## Functional Tests
The flow of the code with various combinations of valid/invalid values has been tested. All test passed at the end and code is working as expected.

## GUI Tests
Many tests were performed from the user interface experience perspective and after few fixes, tests are passed.

Lighthouse Tests

Lighthouse application tests are here for this app

## Bugs
Few issues were noted during testing and could manage to fix all of those before submitting the final app. Few of those are here with respective fixes:

1- After entering 'n' at restart query, game was not ending: Exit() function was not placed correctly

2- Hangman picture was not placed and visible correctly: Fixed some special characters in the code

3- Errors in validator noticed: Extra spaces and length of code in line were causing this

## Credits
I fetched help for coding from tutorial provided by Code Institute, W3 Schools, and Slack community.
